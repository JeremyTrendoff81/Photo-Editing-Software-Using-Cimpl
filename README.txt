Description:____________- This project contains three python files that allow for basic photo editing through 9photo filters. The project utilizes two user interfaces, a interactive UI and a batch UI. The interactive UI displays the user with a set of commands. When a filter command is entered, the resulting image is displayed. The batch UI allows for a text file, with a specific layout, to be parsed through the program and saves the resulting image(s). Appling filters is accumulative.  - The project is made up of three files:	T16_interactive_ui.py	- The interactive UI python script.		T16_batch_ui.py		- The batch UI python script.	T16_image_filters.py	- The filter puthon script.Installation:_____________Python 3.7.4 or later must be installed.Uses functions from Cimpl.py therefore Cimpl.py must be installed for the program to run.Usage:______- All python files must be saved in the same location.- In order to use the batch UI, a text file must be created in the format that can be parsed.The format is: 1) Name of the image to be edited. Include extension.2) The desired filename of the saved image. Include extension.3) The desired filter commands.Example:test_image.png test.png 2 3 Xtest_image.png test1.png T P V - To run the program from the command line, navigate to the directory where the project fileshave been saved and depending on the UI, use one of these commands:> python T16_interactive_ui.pyWhen prompted, enter any of the on-screen commands. Commands are the letters designated with a ')' next to them. Commands can be upper or lowercase.Example:L)oad image, L/l is the command. > python T16_batch_ui.pyWhen prompted, select the text file you'd like to use. Make sure that this file has met the format stated eariler. - The project can also be run through an IDE. To do this, install a python capable IDE, open the desired UI code and run. The python files must still be saved in the same place.    
- Valid commands for the interactive UI are the ones shown. Valid filter commands for the batch UI are, both upper and lower case: '2', '3', 'x', 't', 'p', 'e', 'i', 'v', 'h'.
- When using the interactive UI, filters cannot be executed when no image is loaded.Credits: ________
